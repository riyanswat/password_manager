# Password Manager
A simple password manager GUI written in PyQt5. If the `data.json` doesn't exist, it will create one when you click the Add button. It also has a search functionality: enter the name of the website you want to search for in the data.json and then click search. There aren't any comments (apart from a few just for clarity) because the code is self explanatory
